  随着信息化和工业化的融合，物联网和工业互联网蓬勃发展，由此产生了以
  时间序列为代表的大量工业大数据。时间序列中蕴含着很多有价值的模式，
  对称模式作为一种具有前后对应特征的时间点序列，在各类时间序列中广泛存在。
  挖掘对称模式对于行为分析、轨迹跟踪、异常检测等领域具有重要的研究价值。
  考虑到大规模的时间序列数据给计算资源和运行效率带来的挑战，
  本文将研究一种时间和空间效率均较为高效的对称模式挖掘方法来应对上述问题。

  对称模式涉及到分段时间序列的对比与匹配。
  因此，时间子序列的相似性度量对对称模式挖掘算法的时间性能具有决定性作用。
  一种简单而有效的序列相似性度量方法是欧式距离。
  但是工业应用中时间序列的数据量往往高达几十甚至上百GB，
  基于欧式距离的相似性检索方法计算效率仍然堪忧。
  因此，基于动态时间规整（DTW）算法的启发，本文提出了一种能够
  在$O\left( \left| X \right| \times w \right)$的时间复杂度内
  挖掘出时间序列对称模式的方法。
  具体来说，给定长度约束作为对称模式窗口大小，
  基于区间动态规划算法计算出对称子序列，
  进而依据贪心策略选择数量最多且不重叠对称子序列组成的对称模式。
  通过实验证明，本文提出的对称模式挖掘方法不但在模式挖掘效果上优于
  基于欧式距离的挖掘方法，而且相比基于DTW距离的挖掘方法在效率上
  有了100多倍的提升。

  本文还研究了对称模式挖掘算法在流式时间序列和变长对称模式场景下的扩展。
  流式时间序列可视为一个随时间延续而无限增长的动态数据集合，
  检测流式时间序列的对称性需要满足实时性。
  本文利用改进DTW算法已计算出的状态优化流式算法，
  将每个时间点对称性的计算复杂度由$O\left( w^2 \right)$
  降为了$O\left( w \right)$。此外，同一个时间序列中很可能存在
  不同长度的对称模式，因此，本文利用数据点差分的分布特征，
  设计了能自动调节大小的对称模式窗口。通过实验证明，
  增加了自适应窗口的对称模式挖掘方法比原始方法和其他方法所挖掘出的对称模式
  完整性更高。

  通过研究时间序列对称模式挖掘发现，基于改进DTW算法的对称模式挖掘方法
  不但在模式挖掘效果上优于基于欧式距离的挖掘方法，在性能上也大幅优于
  基于DTW的挖掘方法。最后本文把所提算法进行了系统实现并集成到
  IoTDB-Quality中，完善了工具的功能并加快了工具挖掘对称模式的效率。

\begin{abstract*}
  With the integration of informatization and industrialization, 
  the Internet of Things and the Industrial Internet have 
  flourished, resulting in a large amount of industrial big data 
  represented by time series. There are many valuable patterns 
  in time series. Symmetric patterns, as a series of time points 
  with corresponding features before and after, widely exist 
  in all kinds of time series. Mining symmetric patterns has 
  important research value for behavior analysis, trajectory 
  tracking, anomaly detection and other fields. Considering 
  the challenges brought by large-scale time series data to 
  computing resources and operational efficiency, this paper 
  will study a time- and space-efficient symmetric pattern 
  mining method to deal with the above problems.

  Symmetric patterns involve the comparison and matching of 
  segmented time series. Therefore, the similarity measure 
  of temporal subsequences plays a decisive role in the 
  temporal performance of the symmetric pattern mining algorithm. 
  A simple and effective measure of sequence similarity is 
  Euclidean distance. However, the amount of time series data 
  in industrial applications is often as high as tens or even 
  hundreds of GB, and the computational efficiency of the 
  similarity retrieval method based on Euclidean distance is 
  still worrying. Therefore, based on the inspiration of 
  the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm, this paper 
  proposes a method that can mine symmetric patterns of 
  time series within the time complexity of 
  $O\left( \left| X \right| \times w \right)$. 
  Specifically, given the length constraint as the size of 
  the symmetric pattern window, the symmetric subsequence 
  is calculated based on the interval dynamic programming 
  algorithm, and then the symmetric pattern composed of 
  the largest number of non-overlapping symmetric subsequences 
  is selected according to the greedy strategy. Experiments 
  show that the symmetric pattern mining method proposed 
  in this paper is not only better than the mining method 
  based on Euclidean distance in pattern mining effect, 
  but also has more than 100 times improvement in efficiency 
  compared with the mining method based on DTW distance.

  This paper also investigates the extension of the symmetric 
  pattern mining algorithm to streaming time series and 
  variable-length symmetric pattern scenarios. Streaming time 
  series can be regarded as a dynamic data collection that 
  grows infinitely with time. The symmetry of streaming time 
  series needs to be real-time. This paper uses the 
  state-optimized streaming algorithm calculated by 
  the improved DTW algorithm to reduce the computational 
  complexity of symmetry at each time point from 
  $O\left( w^2 \right)$ to $O\left( w \right)$. 
  In addition, there may be symmetric patterns of different 
  lengths in the same time series. Therefore, this paper uses 
  the distribution characteristics of data point differences 
  to design a symmetric pattern window that can automatically 
  adjust the size. Experiments show that the symmetric pattern 
  mining method with an adaptive window is more complete than 
  the original method and other methods.

  By studying symmetric pattern mining of time series, 
  we found that the symmetric pattern mining method based on 
  the improved DTW algorithm is not only better than the mining 
  method based on Euclidean distance in pattern mining effect, 
  but also significantly better than the mining method based 
  on DTW in performance. Finally, this paper systematically 
  implements the proposed algorithm and integrates it into 
  IoTDB-Quality, which improves the function of the tool and 
  accelerates the efficiency of the tool to mine symmetric 
  patterns.
